## Project Goals:
<ul>
 <li>Create A profile home page with a list of skills and qualification on it</li>
 <li>Create A projects page with a list of completed projects</li>
 <li>Create A contacts page with my contact info</li>
 <li>Use Bootstrap to make a navbar and structure the webpages</li>
<ul>

## Work flow:

<p>I started by putting page elements in rows and collums using Bootstrap, this seperated the home page into 2 collums,
a smaller one for bullet pointed information and a larger one for paragraphs of infomation. I then filled the page with
relevant infomation about my skills and qualifications. Finally I put a photo of myself in the top left in a circular shape.</p>

<p>I then created the other pages with a similar structure and filled them with relevant content. Finally I used a bootstrap
template to create a responsive navbar with links to the other pages in it as well as a link to the Sparta Global website.</p>
